🗄️ **Day 10 of 30: Database Design Isn't Scaling If You're Just "Adding Tables"**

Most junior developers think backend engineering is about writing code. Senior engineers know it's about **designing the data architecture.**

For Day 10 of my 30-day challenge, I went deep into **Database Schema Design**. I built a highly normalized E-commerce engine that showcases how to balance data integrity with query performance.

💡 **The 3 Architecture Principles I implemented:**
✅ **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**: Eliminating redundancy to ensure a single source of truth—critical for multi-million transaction systems.
✅ **Indexing for Scale**: Beyond primary keys, I implemented strategic B-Tree indexes on foreign keys to optimize Join performance.
✅ **Relational Integrity**: Strict constraints that prevent the #1 database nightmare—orphaned records and inconsistent order history.

🛠️ **Tech Stack**: PostgreSQL/SQLite + Mermaid (ERDs) + Python (SQLAlchemy)

**Hiring Managers:** Scaling a backend starts with a solid foundation. I don't just write queries; I architect schemas that grow with the business.

## Posting Tips

1. **The Visual**: A clean screenshot of the **Mermaid ERD** from the README. Visual architecture maps are massive scroll-stoppers for technical recruiters.
2. **The Hook**: The contrast between "junior" and "senior" thinking gets immediate attention.
3. **The Value**: Emphasizing "Normal Forms" and "Indexing" shows you understand the *science* of databases, not just the syntax.
